                Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 10 years ago, I've done
                remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, <br/> and collaborated with talented
                people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. I'm quietly<br/>
                confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one
